## -------------Scatter Plots in ggplot---------------------


# Let's play with the geom layer now

# inside geom(), use arguments shape = 1 and size = 4
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt,y = mpg, col = factor(cyl))) + geom_point(shape=3)

# Note that ALL points are of same shape and size, but not same color

# This is because color is MAPPED to a variable, whereas shape and size are assigned 
# constant values. That's why col is an aesthetic and shape/size are attributes

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt,y = mpg, size=hp)) + geom_point(shape=1)



# Remove shape and size arguments from geom(); 

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt,y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape=1)

# Use size to show car horsepower.

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt,y = mpg,size=hp)) + geom_point(shape=1)



# Are you Mapping hp to size or assigning a particlar value to size? 

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt,y = mpg)) + geom_point(shape=1,size=4)




# -------------Let's practice a few more plots----------------------------------------------


# Show four variables using size and colour
# Map col to hp and size to disp 
# disp means engine displacement
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt,y = mpg,col=hp,size=disp)) + geom_point()


# Use geom_text (instead of geom_point) to display a text variable
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt,y = mpg,col=hpsize=disp)) + geom_text(aes(label=cyl))

# This is the first time you are using an aes() function inside a geom layer
# aes(label = cyl) MAPS the label to cylinder value of a data point 


# Type ?geom_text in R console to read more

#practice 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt,y = mpg,col=hp,size=disp)) + geom_point()
