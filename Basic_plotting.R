##-------------- Basic Plotting in R --------------

# See structure of the iris data frame 




# Plot Sepal length and width on x and y axes respectively




# Add a layer of petal length and width using points, use col = "red" 




# Plot Species (factor) as colors; note that now we assign color to a variable in the data frame 
# and R assigns a color to each species automatically
